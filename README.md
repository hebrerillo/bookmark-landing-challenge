## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla JavaScript

### What I learned

I went deeper in the handling of popups with a fixed position, instead of absolute position like the rest of the challenges.


### Continued development

I am not sure if I am handling responsive images correctly, so I would love some feedback in that aspect.
